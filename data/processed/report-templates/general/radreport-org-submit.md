#### RSNA No Longer Publishing New Templates

RadReport templates are intended to provide examples of best practices for diagnostic reporting. Users of RadReport are welcome to download the published templates and to create templates for their personal use. As of December 2022, RSNA is not currently reviewing submitted reporting templates or publishing new templates on [RadReport.org](https://radreport.org/).

RSNA is currently working with the ACR to create structured content that can be more easily adopted into the reporting practice. RadElement Common Data Elements (CDEs) are sets of questions and allowable answers pertaining to a specific reporting use case. CDEs can be applied to clinical practice, research, and performance improvement initiatives in radiology. Learn more about CDEs at [RadElement.org](https://www.radelement.org/)
