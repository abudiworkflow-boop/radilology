#### Terminology

Reactive [bone marrow edema](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bone-marrow-oedema?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Bone marrow oedema") and [osteitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/osteitis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Osteitis") are recommended to be avoided in cases of infection as these can occur in non-infectious conditions, e.g. inflammatory [arthritis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/arthritis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Arthritis") 21.

Acute osteomyelitis is where symptoms are present for <2 weeks and [chronic osteomyelitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chronic-osteomyelitis-1?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Chronic osteomyelitis") is where symptoms are present for >4 weeks 21.

#### Epidemiology

Osteomyelitis can occur at any age. In those without specific risk factors, it is particularly common between the ages of 2-12 years and is more common in males (M:F of 3:1) 6.

#### Diagnosis

The pathological diagnosis of osteomyelitis requires a reliable tissue sample from which bacteria are isolated, along with histological findings of inflammatory cells and [osteonecrosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/osteonecrosis-2?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Osteonecrosis") 21.

Given low culture yields (~35%), pathological testing often results in false-negative results. Osteomyelitis can be diagnosed on [MRI](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mri-2?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "MRI") in cases of suspected infection where there are concordant [bone marrow](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bone-marrow?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Bone marrow") signal changes of low T1 signal, high signal on fluid-weighted sequences, and post-contrast enhancement 21.

The phrase "high likelihood of osteomyelitis" is recommended where there is bone marrow high signal on fluid-weight sequences adjacent to an [ulcer](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ulcer-soft-tissue?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Ulcer (soft tissue)"), [abscess](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/abscess?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Abscess"), or [sinus tract](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sinus-tract?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Sinus tract"), no matter the T1 signal intensity 21.

#### Pathology

In most instances, osteomyelitis results from hematogenous spread, although direct extension from trauma and/or ulcers is relatively common (especially in the feet of diabetic patients).

In the initial stages of infection, bacteria multiply, triggering a localized inflammatory reaction that results in localized cell death. With time, the infection becomes demarcated by a rim of granulation tissue and new bone deposition.

Although no organisms are cultured from tissue sampling in ~35% (range 21-50%) of cases 1,21, when one is isolated, _Staphylococcus aureus_ is by far the most common pathogen. Different organisms are more common in specific clinical scenarios 1,4,21:

- _Staphylococcus aureus_: 80-90% of all infections; includes methicillin-resistant isolates (MRSA)

- _Escherichia coli_: [intravenous drug users (IVDU)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/people-who-inject-drugs?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) and genitourinary tract infection

- _Pseudomonas_ spp.: intravenous drug use and genitourinary tract infection

- _Klebsiella_ spp.: intravenous drug use and genitourinary tract infection

- _Salmonella_ spp.: [sickle cell disease](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sickle-cell-disease?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

- _Haemophilus influenzae_: neonates

- group B streptococci: neonates

Other uncommon infective agents include fungi (see: [fungal osteomyelitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fungal-osteomyelitis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)).

##### Location

Frequency by location, in descending order 18:

- [lower limb](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/lower-limb-anatomy?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) (most common)

- [vertebrae](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vertebra?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us): lumbar > thoracic > cervical

- radial styloid

- [sacroiliac joint](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sacroiliac-joint?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

The location of osteomyelitis within a bone varies with age, on account of changes in vascularization of different parts of the bone 1,4:

- neonates: metaphysis and/or epiphysis

- children: metaphysis

- adults: epiphyses and subchondral regions

##### Variants

- [emphysematous osteomyelitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/emphysematous-osteomyelitis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

#### Radiographic features

MRI has the highest accuracy to detect osteomyelitis with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of  ~80% 21. In some instances, imaging features are specific to a region or a particular type of infection, for example:

- [subperiosteal abscess](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subperiosteal-abscess-of-the-mastoid?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

- [Brodie abscess](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/brodie-abscess-1?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

- [Pott puffy tumor](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pott-puffy-tumor-1?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

- [sclerosing osteomyelitis of Garré](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sclerosing-osteomyelitis-of-garre?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

Below are the general features of osteomyelitis.

##### Plain radiograph

The earliest changes are seen in adjacent soft tissues +/- muscle outlines with swelling and loss or blurring of normal fat planes. An [effusion](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/joint-effusion?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Joint effusion") may be seen in an adjacent joint.

In general, osteomyelitis must extend at least 1 cm and compromise ~40% (range 30-50%) of bone mineral content to produce noticeable changes on plain radiographs ref. Early findings may be subtle, and changes may not be obvious until 5 to 7 days from the onset in children and 10 to 14 days in adults ref. On radiographs taken after this time period, a number of changes may be noted ref:

- [regional osteopenia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/regional-osteopenia-2?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

- [periosteal reaction](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/periosteal-reaction?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)/thickening (periostitis): variable; may appear aggressive, including the formation of a [Codman's triangle](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/codman-triangle-periosteal-reaction?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) 6

- focal bony lysis or cortical loss

- [endosteal scalloping](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/endosteal-scalloping?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) 8

- loss of [trabecular bone](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cancellous-bone?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) architecture

- new bone apposition

- eventual peripheral sclerosis

In chronic or untreated cases, [chronic osteomyelitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chronic-osteomyelitis-1?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Chronic osteomyelitis") with distinctive imaging characteristics may develop.

##### Ultrasound

Although ultrasound excels as a fast and inexpensive examination of the soft tissues and can guide the drainage of soft tissue collections, it has little role in the direct assessment of osteomyelitis, as it is unable to visualize within the bone ref.

It does, however, have a role in the assessment of soft tissues and joints adjacent to infected bone, as it can be used to visualize soft tissue abscesses, [cellulitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cellulitis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us), subperiosteal collections, and [joint effusion](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/joint-effusion?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) ref.

Ultrasound is also useful in assessing the extraosseous components of orthopedic instrumentation, as it is not affected by metal artifacts 3.

##### CT

CT is superior to both MRI and plain radiographs in depicting the bony margins and identifying a [sequestrum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bony-sequestrum?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Bony sequestrum") or [involucrum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/involucrum?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Involucrum"). The CT features are otherwise similar to plain radiographs. The overall sensitivity and specificity of CT is low, even in the setting of [chronic osteomyelitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chronic-osteomyelitis-1?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us), and according to one study are 67% and 50%, respectively 17.

Intravenous contrast allows CT to differentiate between different tissue types and characterize abscesses 22, but is inferior to MRI scan in this aspect 24.

Some features on CT include 23:

- blurring of fat planes

- increased density of fatty marrow

- periosteal reaction

- cortical erosion/destruction

- [sequestra](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bony-sequestrum?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Bony sequestra"), [involucra](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/involucrum?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Involucra"), intraosseous gases in chronic osteomyelitis

Some limitations CT include 20:

- inability to confidently detect marrow edema; therefore, a normal CT does not exclude early osteomyelitis.

- image degradation by streak artifact when metallic implants are present

##### MRI

MRI is the most sensitive and specific and is able to identify soft-tissue/joint complications 5,14. [Bone marrow edema](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bone-marrow-oedema?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) is the earliest feature of acute osteomyelitis seen on MRI and can be detected as early as 1 to 2 days after the onset of infection 20. Concordant low signal T1 and high signal on fluid-sensitive sequences is the hallmark of osteomyelitis on MRI 21.

- **T1**
  - intermediate to low signal central component

  - surrounding bone marrow of lower signal than normal due to edema

  - cortical bone destruction
- **T2**
  - bone marrow high signal
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** post-contrast enhancement of bone marrow, abscess margins, periosteum, and adjacent soft tissue collections

Where there is discordant bone marrow signal change (i.e. high signal on fluid-sensitive sequences but normal T1 signal), the more intense the signal is on fluid-sensitive sequences is (i.e. similar to joint fluid signal), the more likely osteomyelitis is to be present or subsequently develop 21.

##### Nuclear medicine

A number of techniques may be employed to detect foci of osteomyelitis.

These include 2:

###### Bone scintigraphy (Tc-99m)

Increased osteoblastic activity results in increased levels of radiotracer uptake in the surrounding bone, usually both on blood pool and delayed views. It is highly sensitive but not particularly specific.

###### Indium-111labeled WBC scintigraphy

It may be useful in cases of:

- diabetic osteomyelitis, especially combined with Tc-99m-phosphonate imaging 2,7; however, MRI is now generally used in conjunction with plain films 14,15

- orthopedic implants

- vertebral osteomyelitis (Ga-67 is best) 2

- ulcers in bedridden patients with potential underlying osteomyelitis (In-111 with Tc-99m-phosphonate)

###### Gallium-67 scintigraphy

- radiogallium attaches to transferrin, which leaks from the bloodstream into areas of inflammation, showing increased isotope uptake in infection, sterile inflammatory conditions, and malignancy

- imaging is usually performed 18 to 72 hours after injection and is often performed in conjunction with radionuclide bone imaging

- one difficulty with gallium is that it does not show bone detail particularly well and may not distinguish well between bone and nearby soft tissue inflammation

- gallium scans may reveal abnormal accumulation in patients who have active osteomyelitis when technetium scans reveal decreased activity (“cold” lesions) or perhaps normal activity

- gallium accumulation may correlate more closely with inflammatory activity in cases of osteomyelitis than does technetium uptake

###### PET-CT

PET-CT systems are relatively novel techniques that are being applied. FDG-PET may have the highest diagnostic accuracy for confirming or excluding chronic osteomyelitis in comparison with bone scintigraphy, MRI, or leukocyte scintigraphy. It is also considered superior to leukocyte scintigraphy in detecting chronic [osteomyelitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spondylodiscitis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) in the [axial skeleton](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/axial-skeleton?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) 9.

#### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment of osteomyelitis is typical with intravenous antibiotics, often for extended periods. If a collection, [sequestrum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bony-sequestrum?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us), or [involucrum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/involucrum?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us) is present, drainage and/or surgical debridement is often necessary. Amputation is performed after failure of medical therapy or when the infection is life-threatening.

Complications include 1:

- sinus tract formation with occasional superimposed squamous cell carcinoma ( [Marjolin ulcer](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/marjolins-ulcer?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us))

- secondary sarcoma (e.g. [osteosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/osteosarcoma?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)): rare

- [pathological fracture](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pathological-fracture?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us)

- [secondary amyloidosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/amyloidosis?embed_domain=external.radpair.com%27%5B0%5D%27%5B0%5Dfavicon.ico&lang=us "Amyloidosis")
