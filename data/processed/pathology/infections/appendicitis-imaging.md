# Modelling of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of increased human immunodeficiency virus testing and immediate antiretroviral therapy at diagnosis in men who have sex with men in the UK

This final section describes the results of modelling analyses that take into account the information generated in studies done in the programme, as well as building on the research from published cohort studies and other studies over the past 20 years. The work was reported in two papers. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#) The first concentrated on understanding influences on the epidemic up to 2012 and described the structure and calibration of the model of HIV transmission, progression and the effect of ART that was developed for this. The model was then used to help us understand the relative influences of sexual risk behaviour change, rates of HIV testing and ART-induced virological suppression on HIV infection incidence up to 2012. [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#) In the second paper we used the model to project future HIV infection incidence and other outcomes over the next 20 years, along with an economic analysis. [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#)

In the model we reconstruct sexual risk behaviour, HIV transmission, progression and the effect of ART for the population of MSM in the UK from 1980 to 2010 using an individual-based stochastic computer simulation model, which captures the key underlying mechanisms that determine these processes (model adapted from that used in Phillips _et al._, [58](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#) itself developed from earlier versions [59](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#)– [61](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#)). We were able to calibrate the model quite closely to a range of data.

The model suggested that, after an initial period of high HIV infection incidence in the early 1980s, incidence declined in response to a decline in CLS. However, after the introduction of effective ART, the model suggests that there was an increase in CLS, associated with a rise in HIV infection incidence. Our analysis suggested that use of treatment, even under a policy of ART initiation only when the CD4 cell count was < 350 cells/µl3, and in the context of a relatively low rate of HIV diagnosis, has had an appreciable impact on HIV infection incidence in the UK, resulting in most (82%) new infections being from people who are yet to be diagnosed. We estimated that incidence would have been 68% higher than that actually observed had ART not been introduced (but sexual risk behaviour changes remaining unchanged) and more than five times higher than the observed had condom use ceased.

Our study helped to explain the observed increase in HIV infection incidence in MSM epidemics over a period in which ART coverage and viral suppression has been increasing. Our analysis suggests it is the counter-effect of concomitant increases in CLS among MSM as a whole that has resulted in a net increase in incidence; the model outputs were not consistent with the data unless we assumed such a rise.

An implication of our finding was that extension of ART coverage, by increasing rates of diagnosis and with initiation of ART at higher CD4 cell counts, was likely to have an appreciable effect on reducing HIV infection incidence in MSM epidemics, so long as this does not also result in increases in CLS. A major public health implication of our work is the need to promote frequent HIV testing and to offer ART for the purposes of reduction in infectivity. A second important message is the fact that promotion of condom use remains a critically important and effective element of prevention policies as it is acting to prevent more dramatic increases in HIV infection incidence.

The analysis was useful for understanding the influences on the epidemic, but in order to assess cost-effectiveness of different policy options it was necessary to project forward in time. We did this in a follow-on modelling exercise conducted in the last year of the research programme, and used the same model as that described above. For projecting forward, we assumed that levels of CLS and rates of testing would remain as they were in 2012.

Having reconstructed the epidemic to date, we projected outcomes to 2030, first assuming that there was no change in HIV testing patterns or in the initiation criteria for ART (CD4 cell count of 350/µl). We then considered outcomes under scenarios in which, from 2015, rates of testing were increased.

We found that for increased testing and earlier ART use to lead to a HIV infection incidence of < 1 per 1000 person-years, an increase in the overall proportion of MSM living with HIV who are virally suppressed on ART from the current level of 60% at present to 90% is needed, without any concomitant increases in CLS. A decline in incidence to around this level is required for us to see a reduction in the number of MSM living with a HIV infection. We argued that achieving such high levels of viral suppression is likely to require a cultural change in the approach to HIV testing, such that around 90% of men with HIV are diagnosed within 1 year of infection, together with initiation of ART at diagnosis. Interestingly, we find that increases in testing alone would have a substantial impact on incidence, at least as much or more than the effect of initiation of ART at diagnosis alone. Considering the potentially lower costs of ART associated with use of generic antiretrovirals, we found that there was scope for spending substantial funds in expanding HIV testing, which might include widespread free self-testing, greater testing outreach, simplified testing at clinics combined with regular telephone texting recall, improved partner notification and testing, and promotion of greater awareness of symptoms of primary HIV infection. It has been reported that online advertising campaigns directly lead to an increased uptake of requests for use of free self-sampling kits. If substantial increases in testing were achieved, our results suggest incidence should drop fairly rapidly as a result, potentially allowing the impact to be seen over a short time span, and it is of note that in 2015 the new NHS England policy was to provide ART to people with CD4 cell counts of > 350 cells/µl if this was needed to prevent transmission. [62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459101/#)

Our findings point to the need for future research into means of greatly increasing the frequency with which men test for HIV. Self-testing may play an important role here, and we are investigating this in ongoing research. Modelling of the impact of introduction of PrEP is also important, with its potential impact on levels of CLS and HIV testing.

In conclusion, we found that substantial investment in increasing HIV testing uptake and frequency in MSM is likely to be a highly cost-effective means of reducing HIV infection incidence. However, it is important that levels of risky CLS do not increase, and that ART retention and adherence remain at a high level.
