Clinical History

We report on the case of a previously healthy 11 years-old boy who was referred to our centre with a 48-hours history of progressively increasing abdominal pain. The child was febrile at 40 degrees. Nonbilious emesis was observed. On admission, the pain was located at both right flank and right iliac fossa with neither guarding nor rigidity. Initial laboratory values were as follows: CRP 27mg/L; white blood cell count 15G/L with neutrophils at 13G/L. Urinary dipstick was positive for proteins (2+) but negative for leukocytes and nitrites. A first US examination performed in emergency showed no argument for acute appendicitis. Chest radiograph was normal. Surgery was postponed and it was decided to redo US on the next day, the child being otherwise stable.

Imaging Findings

At day 1, the pain had spread over the whole abdomen. C-Reactive Protein and leukocytes were both increased (153mg/L and 17G/L, respectively). A new US scan confirmed normal appendix and no sign of inflammation in the right iliac fossa. Colour Doppler US showed a vascular defect of the hyperechoic upper pole of the right kidney (Fig.1A) compatible with nephritis. No sign of either pyelitis or ureteritis was found and the left kidney was normal. Abdominal MRI was performed immediately without contrast injection.

MRI sequences included T2- weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in both axial and coronal planes. Both (Fig.1B, C) showed non dilated and moderately enlarged right kidney. High signal intensity foci and microabscesses typical of nephritis predominating at the right upper pole were visible on diffusion tensor imaging (Fig. 1C). Apparent diffusion coefficient was decreased in the same areas (Fig.1D). No sign of ureteritis or pyelitis was found.

Considering the negativity of the initial urinary test, _Enterococcus_ urinary tract infection was the first hypothesis and antibiotic therapy associating amoxicillin and gentamicin was started.

At day 4, the culture confirmed the diagnosis and grew _Enteroccocus faecalis_ 105/mL with 104/mL leukocytes. Apyrexia and pain regression were then obtained, allowing the patient to leave the facility. Voiding cystourethrography was discussed but not performed in the absence of previous history, of dilatation of renal cavities or any sign of inflammation of the upper urinary tract.

Discussion

Acute abdominal pain with fever is a frequent association of symptoms in children that can lead to surgery. Ultrasonography (US) is cornerstone examination in these children, the most frequent diagnosis being acute appendicitis. However, urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent and sometimes tricky differential diagnosis \[1\]. _Enterococcus_ nephritis can be challenging as nitrites are usually negative on dipstick examination. Ultrasound can be evocative like in the present case. Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) can also be used to detect inflammatory changes in renal parenchyma in these patients with acute pyelonephritis \[2\] mostly based on diffusion-weighted sequences \[3\]. MRI could be useful as a complement to US to assert the diagnosis, especially if pyelonephritis is suspected. If venous puncture and injection are unnecessary, sedation is sometimes required. This non-invasive radiation and contrast medium free strategy associating US and MRI may avoid unnecessary CT or even surgery in children with unclear acute abdominal pain.
