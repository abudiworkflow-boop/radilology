**Extradural hematoma (hemorrhage) (EDH)**,** **or **epidural hematoma** **(hemorrhage)**, is caused by moderate to severe head trauma, sufficient to fracture the skull and lacerate a blood vessel, often the [middle meningeal artery](/articles/middle-meningeal-artery?lang=us). Forceful arterial hemorrhage strips the periosteal layer of the [dura mater](/articles/dura-mater?lang=us) from the [calvarium](/articles/cranial-vault?lang=us) to form a biconvex hematoma which is usually limited by the sutures. A large EDH causes a precipitous rise in [intracranial pressure](/articles/intracranial-pressure?lang=us) and [brain herniation](/articles/brain-herniation-1?lang=us) which constitutes a neurosurgical emergency.

Intracranial [venous extradural hemorrhages](/articles/extradural-haemorrhage-venous?lang=us) and [spinal epidural hemorrhages](/articles/spinal-epidural-hematoma-2?lang=us) are discussed separately.

#### Epidemiology

EDH is typically seen in adults under 50 years and in children who are injured in traffic accidents, high energy falls, or by a blow to the head. Up to 80% occur in males.

#### Clinical presentation

- 
acute transient loss of consciousness (~60%) or progressive decline in consciousness level (worse prognosis)

there may be a lucid interval (<20%)

- severe [headache](/articles/headache-overview?lang=us), due to stripping of the dura from the calvarium and stretching of the meninges

- nausea and vomiting

- focal neurological deficit, e.g. hemiparesis

- [abducens nerve palsy](/articles/abducens-nerve-palsy-1?lang=us), often ipsilateral as downward herniation begins

- dilated, non-reactive pupil ipsilateral to the hematoma, due to compression of the [oculomotor nerve](/articles/oculomotor-nerve?lang=us) as a result of [uncal herniation](/articles/uncal-herniation-1?lang=us)

- further signs of [increased intracranial pressure](/articles/raised-intracranial-pressure?lang=us), e.g. bradycardia, hypertension, coma or even death

#### Pathology

The source of bleeding is typically a torn meningeal artery, usually the [middle meningeal artery](/articles/middle-meningeal-artery?lang=us) (75% 7). An associated skull fracture is present in ~75% of cases, often linear and affecting the temporoparietal region 3. With increasing age, the dura becomes tightly adherent to the inner surface of the skull, limiting the potential space available so that large EDHs are rare in the elderly, but when they do occur they often have a poor outcome 13. Instead, the elderly are more prone to low energy falls and [subdural hematomas](/articles/subdural-hemorrhage-2?lang=us).

Posterior fossa EDH is rare (<5%) in adults and is uncommon in children (<10%). It is associated with occipital trauma and can present with rapid deterioration 4.

A [venous extradural hemorrhage](/articles/extradural-haemorrhage-venous?lang=us) is uncommon and occurs when a dural venous sinus is torn, and is associated with [sutural diastasis](/articles/sutural-diastasis?lang=us) and tearing of the dura. Please see that article for further details.

LocationExtradural hematomas are unilateral in more than 95% of cases, however, bilateral or multiple extradural hematomas are reported.

- 
>95% are supratentorial

temporoparietal: 60%

- frontal: 20%

- parieto-occipital: 20%

- <5% are located infratentorially in [posterior fossa](/articles/posterior-cranial-fossa?lang=us) 4

Special locations to consider, particularly those related to [venous extradural bleeding](/articles/extradural-haemorrhage-venous?lang=us), include: 

- vertex extradural hematoma (which displaces the superior sagittal sinus) 6

- 
anterior middle cranial fossa (anterior temporal) 7

likely venous bleeding (from the sphenoparietal sinus)

- do not cause midline shift or herniation

- rarely enlarge

- can often be managed conservatively 

#### Radiographic features

The morphology of EDH is best understood by reviewing the anatomy of the calvarium and dura. An EDH is located on the inside of the skull, between the inner table of the skull and the parietal layer of the [dura mater](/articles/dura-mater?lang=us). As a result, extension is usually limited by the calvarial sutures; the periosteum exits through the suture and is continuous with the extracranial periosteal layer. This is resonsible for the distinguishing features of EDH; in contrast, [subdural hematomas](/articles/subdural-hemorrhage-2?lang=us) are not limited by sutures and spread more widely, adopting a crescentic shape.

EDH can cross venous sinuses and displace them from the skull where they deviate from sutures; venous sinuses are located between the parietal and visceral layers of the dura.

Importantly, an EDH can cross sutures, and this is facilitated by fractures that involve and widen sutures (diastasis), and in vertex EDH which displaces the [superior sagittal sinus](/articles/superior-sagittal-sinus?lang=us) away from the inner table of the skull 6. This is more common in children, and in [abusive head trauma](/articles/abusive-head-trauma?lang=us), with one series finding that up to 11% of EDH in children cross sutures 5. Venous hemorrhage is important to recognize because of the possibility of catastrophic intraoperative hemorrhage.

CTIn almost all cases, extradural hematomas are seen on CT scans of the brain. They are typically bi-convex (or lentiform) in shape, and most frequently beneath the squamous part of the [temporal bone](/articles/temporal-bone-1?lang=us). EDHs are hyperattenuating, somewhat heterogeneous, and sharply demarcated. When acute bleeding is occurring at the time of CT scanning the non-clotted fresh blood is typically less hyperattenuating, and a [swirl sign](/articles/swirl-sign-intracranial-haemorrhage?lang=us) may be evident 1. Depending on their size, secondary features of [mass effect](/articles/mass-effect?lang=us) (e.g. [midline shift](/articles/midline-shift?lang=us), [subfalcine herniation](/articles/subfalcine-herniation?lang=us), [uncal herniation](/articles/uncal-herniation-1?lang=us)) may be present.

Postcontrast extravasation may be seen rarely in case of acute extradural hematoma and peripheral enhancement due to granulation and neovascularization can be seen in chronic extradural hematomas.

MRIMRI can clearly demonstrate the displaced dura that appears as a hypointense line on T1 and T2 sequences which is helpful in distinguishing it from a subdural hematoma.

Acute extradural hematoma appears isointense on T1 and shows variable intensities from hypo- to hyperintense on a T2 sequence. Early subacute extradural hematoma appears hypointense on T2 while late subacute and chronic extradural hematomas are hyperintense on both T1 and T2 sequences.

Intravenous contrast may demonstrate displaced or occluded venous sinus in case of the venous origin of extradural hematomas.

AngiographyIt can be used to evaluate nontraumatic cause (i.e. [AVM](/articles/arteriovenous-malformation-2?lang=us)) of extradural hematomas. Rarely angiography can demonstrate middle meningeal artery laceration and contrast extravasation from the middle meningeal artery into paired middle meningeal veins known as "tram track sign".

#### Treatment and prognosis

Prognosis, even with a relatively large hematoma, is in general quite good, as long as the clot is evacuated promptly. A smaller hematoma without mass effect or swirl sign can be treated conservatively 2, sometimes resulting in calcification of the dura.

Indications for surgical evacuation are 8:

- EDH volume greater than 30 cm³ on CT, regardless of [GCS](/articles/glasgow-coma-scale-1?lang=us)

- EDH thickness greater than 15 mm or [midline shift](/articles/midline-shift?lang=us) greater than 5 mm in a patient with neurological symptoms or deterioration

- comatose patients ([GCS](/articles/glasgow-coma-scale-1?lang=us) <9) with anisocoria or other signs of herniation

- any neurological deterioration attributable to EDH (e.g. decreasing [GCS](/articles/glasgow-coma-scale-1?lang=us), new focal neurological deficits, pupillary changes), even if initial imaging criteria are not met

- posterior fossa EDH: risk of rapid brainstem compression

- EDH enlargement on serial imaging or presence of active arterial bleeding, especially with concurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage

[Venous EDH](/articles/extradural-haemorrhage-venous?lang=us) can bleed copiously during surgery; preoperative recognition and planning are important to mitigate the risks.

ComplicationsOccasionally late complications are encountered, usually relating to the injured meningeal vessel. They include:

- [pseudoaneurysm](/articles/false-aneurysm?lang=us)

- [arteriovenous fistula](/articles/dural-arteriovenous-fistula?lang=us)

#### Differential diagnosis

With large hematomas, there is rarely significant confusion as to the correct diagnosis. In smaller lesions, especially when there is associated parenchymal injury (e.g. [cerebral contusions](/articles/cerebral-hemorrhagic-contusion-1?lang=us), [traumatic subarachnoid blood](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=traumatic-subarachnoid-blood&lang=us), concurrent [subdural hematoma](/articles/subdural-hemorrhage-2?lang=us)) the diagnosis can be more challenging.

Differential considerations include:

- 
[subdural hemorrhage (SDH)](/articles/subdural-hemorrhage-2?lang=us)

often no history of head trauma

- can cross sutures

- usually sickle-shaped

- limited by dural reflections

- usually in older patients or in young patients with significant other closed head injuries

- for further information, see: [extradural hematoma vs subdural hematoma](/articles/extradural-haematoma-vs-subdural-haematoma?lang=us)

- 
[meningioma](/articles/meningioma?lang=us)

maybe hyperattenuating

- enhances with contrast

- usually remote from the fracture (e.g. parafalcine)
