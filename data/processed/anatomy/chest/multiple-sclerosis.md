**Multiple sclerosis (MS) **is a relatively common acquired chronic [demyelinating disease](/articles/demyelinating-disease?lang=us) involving the central nervous system and is the second most common cause of neurological impairment in young adults, after [trauma](/articles/trauma?lang=us) 19. Characteristically and by definition, multiple sclerosis is disseminated in space (i.e. multiple lesions in different regions of the brain), and generally is also (but does not need to be) disseminated in time (i.e. lesions occur at different times).

A number of clinical variants are recognized, each with specific, albeit overlapping, imaging findings and clinical presentation. They include: 

- 
classic multiple sclerosis (Charcot type)

pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (variably defined as multiple sclerosis with an onset <16-18 years of age)

- [tumefactive multiple sclerosis](/articles/tumefactive-multiple-sclerosis?lang=us)

- [Marburg type (acute malignant)](/articles/marburg-variant-of-multiple-sclerosis?lang=us)

- [Schilder type (diffuse cerebral sclerosis)](/articles/schilder-type-multiple-sclerosis?lang=us)

- [Baló concentric sclerosis](/articles/balo-concentric-sclerosis-3?lang=us)

- [opticospinal multiple sclerosis](/articles/opticospinal-multiple-sclerosis-1?lang=us)

This article concerns itself primarily with classic (Charcot-type) multiple sclerosis. Other variants, as well as other conditions previously erroneously encompassed by multiple sclerosis (e.g. [NMOSD](/articles/neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorder?lang=us), [MOGAD](/articles/myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-antibody-associated-disease-mogad?lang=us)), are discussed separately.

#### Epidemiology

The presentation is usually between adolescence and the sixth decade, with a peak at approximately 35 years of age 12,19. Up to 10% of patients have pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis 31. There is a strong, well recognized female predilection with a F:M ratio of approximately 2:1 19. 

Multiple sclerosis has a fascinating geographic distribution: it is rarely found in equatorial regions (e.g. 15 per 100,000), with incidence gradually increasing with distance from the equator (e.g. 250 per 100,000) 12,19. 

Twin studies show a heritability of ~30% 38.

Risk factors

- a strong association with *HLA-DR15* (formerly covered by *HLA-DR2*) class II has been identified 35

- several studies showed a correlation between prior EBV infection and multiple sclerosis onset, both in the adult and pediatric population 38

#### Diagnosis

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires the constellation of clinical findings and various investigations, incorporated into the [McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis](/articles/mcdonald-diagnostic-criteria-for-multiple-sclerosis-4?lang=us), including 42:

- clinical history

- [CSF](/articles/cerebrospinal-fluid-1?lang=us) oligoclonal bands or kappa free light chains

- abnormal visual evoked potential (VEP) or optical coherence tomography (OCT)

- MRI

- lack of viable alternative diagnosis

#### Clinical presentation

Clinical presentation is both highly variable acutely, as a result of varying plaque location, as well as over time. Examples of common clinical features include 23,24:

- 
brainstem and cranial nerve involvement:

[optic neuritis](/articles/optic-neuritis?lang=us)

- [internuclear ophthalmoplegia](/articles/internuclear-ophthalmoplegia?lang=us) (often bilateral)

- [trigeminal neuralgia](/articles/trigeminal-neuralgia?lang=us)

- diplopia (e.g. due to [abducens nerve palsy](/articles/abducens-nerve-palsy-1?lang=us))

- vertigo

- 
cerebellum involvement:

[ataxia](/articles/ataxia-clinical-sign?lang=us) and gait disturbance

- [oscillopsia](/articles/oscillopsia?lang=us)

- 
cerebrum and spinal cord involvement:

sensory loss or paresthesias

- upper motor neuron signs

- [Lhermitte sign](/articles/lhermitte-sign-spinal-cord?lang=us)

- urinary incontinence

- 
others:

fatigue

- [depression](/articles/major-depressive-disorder?lang=us)

- [Uhthoff phenomenon](/articles/uhthoff-phenomenon-multiple-sclerosis-1?lang=us): heat and exercise worsen symptoms

- cognitive impairment

- gastrointestinal prodrome (e.g. [irritable bowel syndrome](/articles/irritable-bowel-syndrome?lang=us), [gastritis](/articles/gastritis?lang=us), [duodenitis](/articles/duodenitis?lang=us)) 51

TypesA number of patterns of longitudinal disease have been described 11,12:

- 
**relapsing-remitting (RRMS)**

most common in adults (70% of cases), even more common in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (98% of cases) 31

- patients exhibit periodic symptoms with complete recovery (early on)

- 
**secondary progressive (SPMS)**

approximately 85% of adult patients with relapsing-remitting MS eventually enter a secondary progressive phase, but this is less common in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis

- 
**primary progressive (PPMS)**

uncommon in adults (10% of cases) and very rare in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis 31

- defined by a progressive accumulation of disability for >12 months from disease onset, which can be determined prospectively or retrospectively

- patients do not have remissions, with neurological deterioration being relentless

- incorporates the previously described "progressive-relapsing" phenotype

- 
**benign multiple sclerosis**

15-50% of cases

- defined as patients who remain functionally active for over 15 years, and thus is only a retrospective diagnosis

As is evident from this list, there is overlap, and in some cases, patients can drift from one pattern to another (e.g. relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive).

Upon presentation patients often have evidence of multiple previous asymptomatic lesions, and the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be strongly inferred. In other instances patients present with the first plaque. This is known as [clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)](/articles/clinically-isolated-syndrome?lang=us) and not all patients go on to develop multiple sclerosis.

[Radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS)](/articles/radiologically-isolated-syndrome?lang=us) is another entity based on MRI brain findings which described as incidental white matter lesions suggestive of MS on imaging in a patient without associated clinical symptoms 17.

#### Pathology

The exact etiology is poorly known although it is believed to have both genetic and acquired contributory components. An infectious agent (e.g. EBV), or at least a catalyst, has long been suspected due to the geographic distribution and presence of clusters of cases; however, no agent has yet been firmly confirmed. Additionally the presence in 3-7% of patients with multiple sclerosis of often striking and symmetric high T2/FLAIR signal of the intrapontine segments of the trigeminal nerve has led some to speculate whether there is a neurotropic viral cause from the aerodigestive tract 34.

Some authors also suggested that "chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency" can cause or exacerbate multiple sclerosis but this theory has not been proven by further investigations 15.

Multiple sclerosis is believed to result from a cell-mediated autoimmune response against one's own myelin components, with loss of [oligodendrocytes](/articles/oligodendrocytes?lang=us), with little or no axonal degeneration in the acute phase; however, in later stages, loss of oligodendrocytes results in axonal degeneration. 

Demyelination occurs in discrete perivenular foci, termed plaques, which range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters 19. Each lesion goes through three pathological stages:

- 
early acute stage (active plaques)

active myelin breakdown 

- plaques appear pink and swollen

- 
subacute stage

plaques become paler in color ("chalky")

- abundant macrophages

- 
chronic stage (inactive plaques/gliosis)

little or no myelin breakdown

- gliosis with associated volume loss

- appear grey/translucent

#### Radiographic features

Plaques can occur anywhere in the central nervous system. They are typically ovoid in shape and perivenular in distribution. 

CTCT features are usually non-specific, and significant change may be seen on MRI with an essentially normal CT scan. Features that may be present include:

- plaques can be homogeneously hypoattenuating 8,11 

- brain atrophy may be evident in long-standing MS 5

- some plaques may show contrast enhancement in the active phase 7,11

MRIMRI has revolutionised the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with MS. Not only can an MRI confirm the diagnosis (see [McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis](/articles/mcdonald-diagnostic-criteria-for-multiple-sclerosis-4?lang=us)), but follow-up scans can assess response to treatment and help determine the disease pattern.

ProtocolAlthough many sequences are contributory, the 2018 Revised Guidelines of the Consortium of MS Centers MRI Protocol for the Diagnosis and Follow-up of MS plaques lists the following core sequences 25: 

- 
FLAIR (axial and sagittal)

ideally performed as a 3D volumetric scan (1 mm isotropic), or

- 3 mm contiguous 

- T1: 3D inversion recovery prepared gradient echo

- T2 (axial): 3D or 2D

- DWI (axial)

NB: contrast is not necessary for routine asymptomatic follow-up.

Demyelinating plaquesIn the brain, location of multiple sclerosis plaques can be infratentorial, periventricular, [juxtacortical](/articles/juxtacortical?lang=us) or cortical, or in the deep white matter. The [optic nerves](/articles/optic-nerve?lang=us) may also be involved.

In the [spinal cord](/articles/spinal-cord?lang=us), characteristic lesions tend to be located in the peripheral cord and span less than 3 segments in the craniocaudal dimension. More centrally located or [longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions](/articles/longitudinally-extensive-spinal-cord-lesion?lang=us) are highly atypical and suggest alternative demyelinating conditions such as [NMOSD](/articles/neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorder?lang=us) 43. Lesions involving the [conus medullaris](/articles/conus-medullaris?lang=us) are rare 48. The addition of a STIR sequence on 3 T MRI improves sensitivity for these lesions over T2 FSE or T1-weighted sequences 44.

Demyelinating plaques of multiple sclerosis may have the following signal characteristics:

- 
**T1**

lesions are typically iso- to hypointense ([T1 black holes](/articles/t1-black-holes-1?lang=us)) 

- [callososeptal interface](/articles/callososeptal-interface?lang=us) may have multiple small hypointense lesions ([Venus necklace](/articles/venus-necklace?lang=us)) or the [corpus callosum](/articles/corpus-callosum?lang=us) may merely appear thinned 11 

- hyperintense lesions are associated with brain atrophy and advancing disease 18

- 
**T2**

lesions are typically hyperintense

- acute lesions often have surrounding edema

- 
**FLAIR**

lesions are typically hyperintense

- a very early sign is the [ependymal dot-dash sign](/articles/ependymal-dot-dash-sign?lang=us) 16

- when these propagate centrifugally along the medullary venules and are arranged perpendicular to the lateral ventricles in a triangular configuration (extending radially outward - best seen on parasagittal images), they are termed [Dawson fingers](/articles/dawson-fingers?lang=us)

- FLAIR is more sensitive than T2 in the detection of juxtacortical and periventricular plaques, while T2 is more sensitive to infratentorial lesions

- 
**double inversion recovery (DIR)**

a sequence that suppresses both CSF and white matter signal and offers better delineation of the plaques compared to FLAIR 33

- 
**SWI**

[central vein sign](/articles/central-vein-sign-1?lang=us): at higher field strengths most plaques have been shown to be perivenular (at 3 T, 45% of lesions; at 7 T, 87% of lesions) 19

- [paramagnetic rim lesions](/articles/paramagnetic-rim-lesion?lang=us): may be seen in approximately 50% of patients, presence increases specificity of diagnosis and correlates with disability from disease 32

- 
**T1 C+ (Gd)**

active lesions show enhancement

- enhancement is often incomplete around the periphery ([open ring sign](/articles/open-ring-sign?lang=us))

- 
**DWI/ADC**

active plaques may demonstrate high or low ADC (increased or decreased diffusion) 10,11,22

- also typically open ring in morphology

- 
**PD**

PD images are better at detecting cervical spinal cord MS lesions especially when T2W images fail to demonstrate these lesions 26

- 
**MR spectroscopy** 

[NAA peaks](/articles/n-acetylaspartate-naa-peak?lang=us) may be reduced within plaques, which is the most common and remarkable finding

- [choline](/articles/choline-peak?lang=us) and [lactate](/articles/lactate-peak?lang=us) are found to be increased in the acute pathologic phase

Chronic active lesionsChronic active lesions (CALs) are a distinct type of brain lesion in multiple sclerosis that reflect ongoing, smoldering inflammation and are strongly linked to disease progression and disability:

- [paramagnetic rim lesions](/articles/paramagnetic-rim-lesion?lang=us): show a dark rim on SWI, corresponding to the iron-rich inflammatory border 39,40

- slowly expanding lesions (SELs): identified by gradual, concentric growth over time on serial MRI scans in regions within pre-existing T2 lesions 39,40

- PET imaging can highlight active inflammation at the lesion rim 39

Chronic active lesions are associated with more severe disability, progressive disease, and brain atrophy 39,40.

AtrophyIn addition to focal lesions, multiple sclerosis is also characterized by brain atrophy 45. This can be extensive, with atrophy of 0.5-1.35% seen per year 45. The degree of whole brain atrophy, as determined by volumetric analysis, correlates well with level of disability, while cortical atrophy particularly correlates with cognitive dysfunction 45.

Additionally, [choroid plexus](/articles/choroid-plexus?lang=us) volume (CPV) is emerging as a multiple sclerosis biomarker, with patients with multiple sclerosis having a greater choroid plexus volume compared with healthy controls 41. Choroid plexus volume is also correlated with atrophy measures, lesion load and clinical disability status 41.

#### Treatment and prognosis

The aim of management is twofold:

- curtail progression with disease-modifying therapies

- symptomatic relief

Non-pharmacological preventative therapies include:

- smoking cessation

- vitamin D supplementation

- sun exposure: appears to correlate with a slowing down of the rate of progression of the disease - to clinically important levels - and the risk of disability 30

Disease-modifying therapies include multiple pharmacological agents and autologous [hematopoietic stem cell transplantation](/articles/haematopoietic-stem-cell-transplantation?lang=us). Although discussion of individual agents and therapies is beyond the scope of this article, the main agents available include 20:

- interferon beta: inhibition of T-lymphocyte proliferation

- glatiramer acetate (Copaxone): immunomodulation

- teriflunomide (Aubagio): reduces both T-cell and B-cell activation and proliferation

- dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) and diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): immunomodulation

- fingolimod (Gilenya), siponimod (Mayzent) and ozanimod (Zeposia): prevents lymphocyte migration out of lymph nodes and into CNS

- natalizumab (Tysabri): inhibits binding of lymphocytes to endothelium

- cladribine (Mavenclad): purine analog that targets lymphocytes

- ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), ofatumumab (Kesimpta) and rituximab: anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies

- alemtuzumab (Lemtrada): immunomodulation of T-cell and B-cell function

- mitoxantrone (Novantrone): reduces T-cell and B-cell proliferation and reduces T-cell activation

Prognosis is variable and depends on the pattern of disease a patient has (e.g. primary progressive carries a worse prognosis than relapsing-remitting). In general, patients with relapsing-remitting MS will progress to secondary progressive disease in 10 years and will require ambulatory aids (e.g. cane/wheelchair/frame) in another 5-15 years 12. Approximately half of the affected individuals will no longer be independently ambulatory after 20 years 19. Overall life expectancy is also reduced, by 7-14 years 19.

High serum neurofilament light chain values have been associated with higher risk of relapse and overall worse prognosis 38.

ComplicationsIn addition to the potential for disease progression resulting in progressive neurological impairment, a number of specific complications need to be considered. These include 20,21:

- 
[progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)](/articles/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy?lang=us) and other less common CNS JC virus manifestations ([JC virus granule cell neuronopathy](/articles/jc-virus-granule-cell-neuronopathy?lang=us), [JC virus encephalopathy](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=jc-virus-encephalopathy&lang=us), and [JC virus meningitis](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=jc-virus-meningitis&lang=us))

particularly in patients treated with natalizumab with positive JC virus serology

- 
[PML-IRIS](/articles/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome?lang=us)

a complication of cessation of natalizumab or treatment for natalizumab-related PML with plasma exchange or immunoabsorption 21

- 
[primary CNS lymphoma](/articles/lymphomas-of-the-central-nervous-system?lang=us)

rarely lymphoma appears to arise from previously identified demyelinating lesions

- >2-times increased risk of [stroke](/articles/ischaemic-stroke-2?lang=us) 28, possibly related to chronic inflammatory vasculopathy

#### History and etymology

Multiple sclerosis was first defined by **Jean-Martin Charcot** (1825-1893), French neurologist, in 1868 27.

#### Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis is dependent on the location and appearance of demyelination. For classic (Charcot type) MS, the differential can be divided into intracranial and spinal involvement. 

For intracranial disease, the differential includes:

- all other [demyelinating diseases](/articles/demyelinating-disorders?lang=us) (e.g. [NMOSD](/articles/neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorder?lang=us), [MOGAD](/articles/myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-antibody-associated-disease-mogad?lang=us))

- [migraine](/articles/migraine?lang=us) (most common misdiagnosis in one study) 49

- hereditary [cerebral small vessel diseases](/articles/cerebral-small-vessel-disease?lang=us) (e.g. [CADASIL](/articles/cerebral-autosomal-dominant-arteriopathy-with-subcortical-infarcts-and-leukoencephalopathy-cadasil-1?lang=us), [Fabry disease](/articles/fabry-disease?lang=us), [*COL4A1* brain small-vessel disease](/articles/col4a1-brain-small-vessel-disease?lang=us)) 46,47

- [*CSF1R*-related leukoencephalopathy](/articles/csf1r-related-leukoencephalopathy?lang=us) 47

- [adult-onset Alexander disease](/articles/alexander-disease?lang=us) 47

- [CLIPPERS](/articles/chronic-lymphocytic-inflammation-with-pontine-perivascular-enhancement-responsive-to-steroids-clippers?lang=us)

For spinal involvement, the following should be considered:

- other causes of [transverse myelitis](/articles/transverse-myelitis?lang=us), including other [demyelinating diseases](/articles/demyelinating-disorders?lang=us) (e.g. [NMOSD](/articles/neuromyelitis-optica-spectrum-disorder?lang=us), [MOGAD](/articles/myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-antibody-associated-disease-mogad?lang=us))

- infectious myelitis

- spinal cord tumors (e.g. [astrocytomas](/articles/spinal-astrocytoma?lang=us))

- [spinal cord infarction](/articles/acute-spinal-cord-ischaemia-syndrome?lang=us) (e.g. [sulcal artery syndrome](/articles/sulcal-artery-syndrome?lang=us))

Multiple sclerosis variants (e.g. [tumefactive MS](/articles/tumefactive-ms?lang=us)) are discussed separately.
