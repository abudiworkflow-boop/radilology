#### Epidemiology

Aneurysm rupture, the most common cause of non-traumatic SAH, is exceptional in children and the incidence increases with age. The global incidence is about 8 cases per 100,000 person years 15.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage accounts for 3% of [stroke](/articles/stroke?lang=us) and 5% of stroke deaths 2.

Risk factorsRisk factors include 2:

- family history

- [hypertension](/articles/hypertension?lang=us)

- smoking

- heavy alcohol consumption

- 
abnormal connective tissue

[autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease](/articles/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-1?lang=us)

- [Ehlers-Danlos disease type IV](/articles/vascular-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-1?lang=us)

- [Marfan syndrome](/articles/marfan-syndrome?lang=us)

- [neurofibromatosis type 1](/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1?lang=us)

- female gender: ~1.5x baseline risk 10

- African descent: ~2x baseline risk ref

- Japanese or Finnish descent 12

#### Clinical presentation

SAH accounts for about 25% of [thunderclap headache](/articles/thunderclap-headache?lang=us) presentations. This is described as a sudden-onset headache, the worst headache of their life. Only 50% of SAH presents this way.

SAH may be preceded by exertion and headache is often associated with [photophobia](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=photophobia&lang=us), [meningism](/articles/meningism?lang=us) and emesis. Focal neurological deficits often present either at the same time as a headache or soon thereafter 2.

Almost 50% collapse with impaired consciousness 2.

#### Pathology

Three distinct patterns of subarachnoid hemorrhage have been described, each with its own etiology and treatment/prognostic implications 4:

- suprasellar cistern with diffuse peripheral extension

- perimesencephalic and basal cisterns

- isolated cerebral [convexity](/articles/convexal-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us)

EtiologyCauses include 1:

- [trauma](/articles/traumatic-subarachnoid-haemorrhage-1?lang=us)

- 
spontaneous

#### Classification

The severity of subarachnoid hemorrhage can be graded with clinical and/or radiological systems:

- 
**clinical**

[Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)](/articles/glasgow-coma-scale-1?lang=us)

- [Hunt and Hess grading system](/articles/hunt-and-hess-grading-system-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us)

- [WFNS grading system](/articles/wfns-subarachnoid-haemorrhage-grading-system?lang=us)

- 
**radiological**

[Fisher scale](/articles/fisher-scale-of-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us) / [modified Fisher scale](/articles/modified-fisher-scale-of-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us)

- 
**clinical/radiological**

[VASOGRADE scale](/articles/vasograde-scale-of-delayed-cerebral-ischaemic-risk-after-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us)

#### Radiographic features

Although MRI is thought to be more sensitive, non-contrast CT is frequently performed first due to wider availability. As well as being more sensitive to hemorrhage, MRI has greater sensitivity to the wide range of causative lesions.

The distribution of hemorrhage can point to the site of a ruptured aneurysm with reasonable accuracy, particularly if there is associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

A description of the radiographic features of each causative underlying lesion is beyond the scope of this article; these are discussed separately (see above).

CTThe sensitivity of non-contrast CT to the presence of subarachnoid blood is strongly influenced by both the amount of blood and the time since the hemorrhage.

The diagnosis is suspected when a hyperattenuating blood is seen in the subarachnoid space. This is often located in the anterior interhemispheric fissure, around the [circle of Willis](/articles/circle-of-willis?lang=us), in the Sylvian fissure or posterior cranial fossa, depending of the location of the ruptured aneurysm. The aneurysm may be detectable as a relatively lower attenuation defect, the hypoattenuating berry sign 16.

Small amounts of blood sometimes pool in the interpeduncular fossa, appearing as a small hyperattenuating triangle, or within the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles causing an abnormal, and sometimes subtle, horizontal level 5.

Subarachnoid hemorrhages are grouped into four categories according to the amount of blood on unenhanced CT by the [Fisher scale](/articles/fisher-scale-of-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us). This scale has been updated to the [modified Fisher scale](/articles/modified-fisher-scale-of-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us), which more accurately correlates the risk of vasospasm.

MRIMRI is sensitive to subarachnoid blood and is able to visualize it well in the first 12 hours, typically as a [hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space on FLAIR](/articles/sulcal-flair-hyperintensity?lang=us) 3.

Susceptibility-weighted sequences are also exquisitely sensitive to blood products.

MR angiography and MR venography are also able to detect a causative aneurysm or another source of bleeding, although in general, MRI suffers from poor availability (compared to CT), longer scan times, and greater difficulty in transferring and looking after patients who are often unstable and intubated.

In aneurysm-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage, [diffusion weighted imaging](/articles/diffusion-weighted-imaging-2?lang=us) may demonstrate early ischemic changes (within 0-3 days) in more than half of all patients 8. Additionally, delayed ischemia detected on DWI, associated with vasospasm developing 4-21 days after ictus, may develop in about half of all patients 8.

Angiography (DSA)Digital subtraction catheter angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis and characterization of vascular abnormalities, and in many centers, even if the causative lesion is identified on MRA or CTA and it is thought to require surgical management, a catheter study is carried out.

The benefit of DSA is two-fold:

- higher spatial resolution: better able to delineate small vessels and characterize vascular morphology (e.g. aneurysm neck and incorporation of adjacent vessels)

- temporal resolution: contrast can be seen to wash into and out of vascular malformations, giving important information in regards to the feeding vessels (e.g. arteriovenous malformations or dural arteriovenous fistulas)

Additionally, depending on the cause, endovascular therapy (e.g. aneurysm coiling) may be appropriate.

#### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment will vary according to the underlying cause.

ComplicationsPotential complications encountered are:

- 
elevated intracranial pressure

often require ICP monitoring

serial non-invasive screening is possible in equivocal cases using sonographic indices of [elevated ICP](/articles/raised-intracranial-pressure?lang=us)

- [hydrocephalus](/articles/obstructive-hydrocephalus?lang=us) may require extraventricular drain placement

- 
[cerebral vasospasm](/articles/cerebral-vasospasm-following-subarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us) causing [delayed cerebral ischemia](/articles/delayed-cerebral-ischaemia?lang=us)

triple H therapy (**H**aemodilution, **H**ypertension, **H**ypervolaemia)

- calcium channel blockers (e.g. nimodipine)

- endovascular intervention (e.g. intra-arterial delivery of vasodilating agents (such as NO) and/or balloon angioplasty)

- [hyponatremia](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=hyponatraemia&lang=us)

- [coronary spasm](/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=coronary-spasm&lang=us)

- neurogenic [pulmonary edema](/articles/pulmonary-oedema?lang=us)

- [pulseless electrical activity (PEA)](/articles/pulseless-electrical-activity?lang=us) 13

Prognosis varies greatly depending on:

- cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage

- grade of subarachnoid hemorrhage

- presence of other injuries/pathologies/co-morbidities

A small amount of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage or small perimesencephalic blood has an excellent prognosis with little if any significant long-term sequelae. A grade V aneurysmal subarachnoid, on the other hand, has a dismal prognosis, despite aggressive treatment.

#### Differential diagnosis

It is important to realize that apparent hyperattenuation in the subarachnoid space is not pathognomonic of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other diagnostic possibilities include:

- [pseudosubarachnoid hemorrhage](/articles/pseudosubarachnoid-haemorrhage?lang=us)

- [cortical laminar necrosis](/articles/cortical-laminar-necrosis?lang=us): affects the cortex, not the cisterns

- post-thrombectomy iodine extravasation vs hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke extending to cisterns differentiated on DECT iodine map

- [contrast-induced neurotoxicity](/articles/contrast-induced-neurotoxicity?lang=us)

- [bacterial meningitis](/articles/meningitis-2?lang=us)
