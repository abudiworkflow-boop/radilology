Clinical History

A 73-year-old male patient presented with an incidental finding of a complex renal cyst during an abdominal ultrasound (US). The patient had no significant medical history and was asymptomatic. Further imaging studies were ordered for evaluation, including a computerized tomography (CT) scan followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Imaging Findings

The US scan revealed a mainly hyperechoic heterogeneous renal mass with posterior acoustic enhancement on the lower pole of the right kidney, measuring 31 x 33 mm (figure 1).

The patient underwent renal mass protocol CT, which revealed a circumscribed slightly heterogeneous hypodense lesion with hydric attenuation values on unenhanced scans (figure 2a) and indeterminate enhancement on the contrast-enhanced images (figure 2b). It remained uncertain if the mass was complex cystic or solid hypovascular.

A renal mass protocol MRI was performed for further characterization. The right renal mass presented as a cystic lesion with irregular enhancing septa, measuring 36 x 45 mm (figure 3). The lesion was classified as a Bosniak III lesion. There was no invasion of adjacent structures.

The patient underwent radical nephrectomy, and histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma (TC-RCC).

Discussion

TC-RCC is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that has only recently been recognized as a distinct malignant entity (1). It accounts for less than 1% of all RCCs (1). No specific risk factors have been identified (1), but TC-RCC has a strong predilection for males and occurs predominantly in the third to ninth decades of life (2). It mainly affects the left kidney and typically involves the cortex or corticomedullary junction (2). The size varies between 0.5 and 17 cm, with a mean diameter of 4 cm (3). These tumours are generally well-circumscribed, unencapsulated and have a spongy appearance due to small cystic spaces separated by multiple septa (4).The cystic spaces are typically filled with clear serous fluid, and haemorrhagic changes are infrequent (4).

Most patients are asymptomatic on presentation, and TC-RCC can pose diagnostic challenges both clinically and radiologically (1). Although histopathology is key in establishing the diagnosis, TC-RCC can be strongly suggested on imaging using a combination of US, CT, and MRI findings (3). On US, TC-RCC typically appears as a hyperechoic lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement, due to its small multicystic nature (3). CT presents important limitations in characterizing TC-RCC, particularly in the determination of its fluid content and in contrast enhancement detection (3). On CT, these tumours can be described as cystic, indeterminate, or solid; and, when cystic, Bosniak categories II-IV are reported (3). Because of its high sensitivity to detect fluid and subtle contrast enhancement, MRI is particularly useful for characterizing renal cystic masses that are indeterminate at CT and for classifying them properly according to the Bosniak classification system (3, 5). The Bosniak Classification (6) is the most used classification system to categorize cystic renal masses, and it significantly impacts patient management (7, 8). The revised Bosniak classification explicitly recommends performing MRI to further evaluate indeterminate masses at CT that are heterogeneous and non-enhancing (9). On MRI, TC-RCCs are predominantly classified as Bosniak II-IV lesions (3, 5).

Most TC-RCCs are low-grade cystic tumours with an indolent course, discovered incidentally at stage T1 disease (1, 3). The treatment of choice is radical nephrectomy, and the prognosis is generally good. Recurrence or metastases are infrequent, but close follow-up is recommended (1, 3).

**Teaching Points:**

- Multimodal imaging can suggest the diagnosis of TC-RCC.
- TC-RCC typically presents on US as a hyperechoic lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement.
- MRI is more efficient than CT in accurately characterizing TC-RCC, generally presenting as a Bosniak II–IV lesion.
