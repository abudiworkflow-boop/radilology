Clinical History

A one-month-old female infant presented to the emergency department with a palpable, painful mass in her right labia.  Her parents noticed she was uncomfortable,  wept easily and had a decrease in appetite.  On physical examination, the infant was alert, had no fever and showed normal cardiopulmonary auscultation as well as intestinal peristaltis. The labial mass could only partially be reduced manually.

Imaging Findings

Ultrasound examination (Fig. 1 - 3) was performed of the inguinal region and demonstrated an inguinal hernia containing the right ovary (Fig. 2), both fallopian tubes and uterus (Fig. 3, triangle in Fig. 1). The left ovary was also displaced though remained intraperitoneal, positioned on the posterolateral right with respect to the bladder roof. Little internal flow signals could be demonstrated in the herniated structures. Furthermore, there was some contiguous free fluid (arrow in Fig. 1) in the hernia sac. As the risk of strangulation was imminent, reduction and hernia repair were carried out the same day.

Discussion

_Background_

The processus vaginalis (called the canal of Nuck in females) is a tubular fold of peritoneum that extends into the inguinal canal \[1\]. It develops at six months of gestation and contributes, besides the gubernaculum testis, as one of the two main fetal anatomic structures to the prenatal development of the inguinal canal. At eight months of gestation, the processus vaginalis is supposed to obliterate gradually \[1, 2\] . If this does not or only partially occurs,  pelvic contents such as omental fat, bowel, ovary, fallopian tube and rarely the urinary bladder or uterus may herniate through this aperture resulting in a canal of Nuck hernia \[1\].

_Clinical perspective_

Inguinal hernias are not uncommon in infancy, especially among premature infants. It has been reported that up to 30% of those infants develop inguinal hernias, whereby the incidence of (indirect) inguinal hernias is six times higher among males compared to females \[1\]. Typically, a physical exam shows a labial swelling which may or may not be reducible. The groin area is often tender, but erythema or induration of the overlying skin is not expected \[2\]. In up to 10% of the cases, the condition occurs bilaterally, though mostly on the right side \[3\].

The clinical differential diagnosis of inguinal masses in female infants should include Bartholin gland cyst, lymphadenopathy, hydrocele of the canal of Nuck and benign soft tissue masses such as lipoma \[1\].

_Imaging perspective_

When a canal of Nuck hernia is suspected, ultrasound is the modality of choice for initial imaging since it is easily accessible, no unnecessary radiation is used and Doppler-technique enables evaluation of internal flow signals. When there are equivocal sonographic findings, MRI allows the radiologist to better assess herniation of pelvic organs into the canal of Nuck as well as signs of inflammation (e.g. septal enhancement of free fluid in the hernia sac) which may occur \[4\]. Ovaries or fallopian tubes are present in 15%-20% of all canal of Nuck hernias. Herniation of the uterus, however, as present in our case, is highly unusual \[1\].

_Teaching point_

A palpable mass in the groin area can easily be explored with ultrasound to detect a possible underlying canal of Nuck hernia that might warrant urgent surgical exploration if signs of incarceration are present.

Written informed consent for publication has been obtained by the parents of the patient.
