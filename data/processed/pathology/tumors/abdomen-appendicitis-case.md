Clinical History

A 65-year-old male patient presented to the neurology department with paresis and sensory deficits in the upper limbs, progressing over the last 5-6 months, associated in the past week with bilateral lower limb weakness. The medical history was unremarkable. The patient was further referred for a brain and cervical spine MRI.

Imaging Findings

The cervical spine MRI showed diffuse T2-WI/STIR hyperintensity involving a long segment of the cervical and extending down to the upper thoracic spinal cord (C3-T1), with significant cord expansion. In addition, a small cystic area is seen at the proximal third of the lesion. The post-contrast study revealed intramedullary poorly-delineated and heterogeneous enhancement located eccentrically at the C5-C7 level. Therefore, the impression was of a solid infiltrative intramedullary mass with a small area of necrotic/cystic degeneration surrounded by extensive oedema.

The brain MRI only showed evidence of mild small vessel chronic ischemia.

Discussion

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult intracranial primary malignant tumour. However, localization as a primary malignancy in the spinal cord is extremely unusual, accounting for 1 to 5% of all GBMs, with only 200 cases reported in the literature until 2018. \[1,2\]

Unlike its intracranial counterpart, spinal GBM tends to target younger individuals during their second and third decades of life. Unfortunately, from a clinical and prognostic point of view, it follows the pattern of the highly aggressive cerebral GBM, having a median survival rate of 10 to 14 months due to its infiltrative nature that precludes curative surgery. \[1\]

The clinical presentation depends on the tumour location. The cervical and thoracic regions are the most affected (70%), followed by the lumbar cord (9.7%) and conus medullaris (5.5%). Accordingly, the most common symptoms include limb weakness, back pain, and paraparesis. \[3,4\]

MRI is the most suitable imaging tool for diagnosing spinal tumours. Spinal GBMs usually appear as intramedullary longitudinally extensive and infiltrative masses that cause cord expansion, with iso- or low signal on T1-WI and high signal on T2-WI. Cystic or hemorrhagic areas may be associated; calcifications are not characteristic. On post-Gadolinium T1-WI, the appearance may be variable, but they often show heterogeneous enhancement. Like all diffuse gliomas, spinal GBMs exhibit features of restricted diffusion on DWI correlated with the ADC map. However, establishing a definite diagnosis requires biopsy and histopathological evaluation, as differentiation from other spinal tumours or inflammatory conditions may be difficult. Some have suggested the use of F-18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose PET to discriminate between inflammatory and neoplastic, but the risk of increasing intratumoral glycolysis together with the indispensability of the biopsy in the diagnosis algorithm, raised questions about the risks and also the redundancy of the PET examination. \[5,6\]

Dissemination to distant sites is possible through the cerebrospinal fluid, so after the diagnosis is established, an MRI of the whole neuraxis is recommended to detect possible seeding. \[2\]

Due to the rarity of this lesion and, subsequently, limited data in the literature, the optimal therapeutic management is under debate. Total resection is mostly unachievable, so at present, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are recommended, despite little contribution to survival prolonging. \[6,7\]

Our patient underwent partial tumour resection (debulking) with post-operative combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Unfortunately, all therapeutic measures produced disappointing results, with the patient dying two months later.

Despite its rarity, when faced with an expansile intramedullary T2-WI hyperintense lesion that shows enhancement on post-contrast studies, including in a fairly young adult, the radiologist should include in the differential diagnosis spinal GBM and promptly refer the patient for biopsy.

The final diagnosis is primary spinal cord glioblastoma, confirmed with histopathological examination. Immunohistochemically, the analysis of the IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) mutations revealed negative results (IDH-wildtype). The MGMT (O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) methylation status was also negative.
