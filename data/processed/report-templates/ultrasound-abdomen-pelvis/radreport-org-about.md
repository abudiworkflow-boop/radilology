#### RSNA No Longer Publishing New Templates

RadReport templates are intended to provide examples of best practices for diagnostic reporting. Users of RadReport are welcome to download the published templates and to create templates for their personal use. As of December 2022, RSNA is not currently reviewing submitted reporting templates or publishing new templates on [RadReport.org](https://radreport.org/).

RSNA is currently working with the ACR to create structured content that can be more easily adopted into the reporting practice. RadElement Common Data Elements (CDEs) are sets of questions and allowable answers pertaining to a specific reporting use case. CDEs can be applied to clinical practice, research, and performance improvement initiatives in radiology. Learn more about CDEs at [RadElement.org](https://www.radelement.org/)

#### About RadReport

* * *

The radiology report is the essential record of the service provided by the diagnostic radiologist. To deliver value it must be clear, consistent and readable to both humans and computers.

The reporting templates available on RadReport are designed to help radiologists achieve these goals. They have been contributed by radiologists experienced in their respective subspecialties and reviewed by an international panel of experts. Each template is designed to enable radiologists to capture the essential clinical observations using appropriate terminology, measurements, technical parameters, annotations and key images. The templates are offered for free are not subject to licensing restrictions on their use.

RadReport templates:

- Are based on best practices and established technical standards
- Improve communication between radiologists and referring providers
- Help radiology practices meet accreditation criteria and earn pay-for-performance incentives

The RSNA encourages reporting system vendors to support the use of templates based on the IHE MRRT profile, like many of the templates published on RadReport.org.
