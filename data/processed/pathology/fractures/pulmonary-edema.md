## Continuing Education Activity

Shigellosis represents an acute diarrheal illness caused by enteroinvasive _Shigella_ species capable of producing severe inflammation and a wide clinical spectrum ranging from watery diarrhea to dysentery. Transmission commonly occurs via the fecal-oral route, and young children, older adults, immunocompromised individuals, international travelers, and men who have sex with men face heightened risk. This course discusses rising antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of extensively drug-resistant strains, which complicate management, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis via stool culture, careful exposure assessment, and judicious antibiotic selection based on susceptibility data and global resistance patterns.

This activity details _Shigella_ epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and evidence-based treatment approaches. Participants will gain an in-depth understanding of the recommended evaluation of acute diarrheal illness, the diagnostic features of severe disease, the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and the mitigation of resistance risks. The activity also enhances clinicians’ ability to prevent transmission through counseling on hygiene practices, sexual health considerations, and public health reporting. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in identifying _Shigella_, performing the recommended evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional approach when managing this pathogen, ultimately improving patient outcomes and safeguarding community health.

**Objectives:**

- Identify patients at risk for shigellosis based on their clinical history.

- Determine key transmission routes underlying _Shigella_ infections.

- Select appropriate antimicrobial therapy for _Shigella_ infections aligned with clinical factors, including current resistance patterns and patient risk factors.

- Implement effective collaboration among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with shigellosis and to promote public health.

## Introduction

Shigellosis is an acute diarrheal infection caused by an enteroinvasive gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacillus of the genus _Shigella_(see **Image**. Shigellosis). [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Shigellosis is common in developing countries and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. In high-income countries, reports reveal that, in addition to young children, men who have sex with men are at risk for _Shigella_ outbreaks via sexual contact. [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Shigellosis can affect all persons across all age groups, but the very young, older adults, and the immunocompromised are at significantly increased risk for severe disease.

_Shigella_ are less susceptible to destruction by gastric acid than other bacteria when passing through the stomach; a small inoculum, as few as 10 to 100 organisms, may cause disease. After leaving the stomach, _Shigella_ multiply in the small intestine and enter the colon. In the colon, they secrete virulence factors that cause severe inflammation and mediate enterotoxic effects, enabling colonization and invasion of the colonic epithelium. _Shigella_ produces 3 enterotoxins that cause watery or bloody diarrhea and infection-associated symptoms, eg, tenesmus, malaise, and fever. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

The average incubation period of _Shigella_ is 1 to 4 days following ingestion of the inoculum. The main symptom of shigellosis is bloody and often mucoid diarrhea; abdominal pain and vomiting are common. [\[3\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[4\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[5\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Shigellosis is typically self-limited and resolves within 5 to 7 days. Supportive care may be required, and antibiotics could shorten the duration of illness or prevent complications, particularly in individuals at increased risk for severe disease and complications, eg, hemolytic-uremic syndrome and postreactive arthritis. [\[7\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) However, antibiotic resistance is rising within the genus, and extensively drug-resistant _Shigella_ have been identified. [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is critical to ensure appropriate therapeutic selection.

## Etiology

The etiologic agent of shigellosis is a gram-negative, nonmotile, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacillus of the genus _Shigella_ and the Enterobacterales order. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) _Shigella_ comprises 4 species, each representing 1 of the 4 serogroups A to D. Each serogroup comprises 1 or more serotypes with unique biochemical and virulence characteristics. The _Shigella_ serogroups are made up of the following:

- Serogroup A: _Shigella dysenteriae_ (15 serotypes)

- Serogroup B: _Shigella flexneri_ (19 serotypes and subserotypes)

- Serogroup C: _Shigella boydii_ (20 serotypes)

- Serogroup D: _Shigella sonnei_ (1 serotype)

_S flexneri_ is the most common cause of diarrhea worldwide and is endemic in low- and middle-income countries. Although _S boydii_ and _S dysenteriae_ are the least common causes of shigellosis, they are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. _S dysenteriae_ type 1 has a high mortality rate and is a frequent cause of shigellosis outbreaks, causing epidemics in populations going through upheaval. _S sonnei_ is the most common cause of endemic diarrhea in high-income countries and a significant cause of travelers' diarrhea. _S sonnei_ usually causes mild disease limited to watery diarrhea, while _S flexneri_ and _S dysenteriae_ usually cause dysentery with bloody diarrhea. [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

## Epidemiology

Humans are the only natural reservoir for _Shigella_. In high-income countries, the transmission of _Shigella_ is mostly via the fecal-oral route or by direct person-to-person contact, including sexual contact, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). [\[8\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[9\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Transmission frequently occurs between people with poor hygiene and incontinence, eg, young children, those in long-term care facilities, or areas of homelessness and crowding. [\[10\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[11\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) In low- and middle-income countries, transmission via the fecal-oral route is most commonly from contaminated food or water and affects travelers to these regions, but is the most devastating among children under 5 years of age resident in these countries. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

The estimated annual global incidence of shigellosis is 188 million cases; approximately 164,000 cases result in death. [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Children younger than 5 years of age bear the heaviest burden of these deaths as they become at risk after weaning: in 2021, there were an estimated 81,800 _Shigella_ spp deaths in this age group. [\[13\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[12\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Shigellosis outbreaks occur whenever war or natural disasters result in unhygienic living conditions, overcrowding, and poor sanitation. Remarkably, rising global temperatures increase the risk of diarrheal diseases, eg, shigellosis. [\[14\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

Shigellosis has no gender or ethnic predilection. Worldwide, _Shigella_, after rotaviruses, is the second-most common cause of dysentery-associated death in children aged 6 months to 5 years. [\[13\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) _S flexneri_ is the serogroup most responsible for shigellosis in children younger than 5 years in low- and middle-income countries _._

In the United States, shigellosis is the third most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, accounting for an estimated 450,000 cases each year; most cases are caused by _S sonnei_. [\[CDC.Clinical Overview of Shigellosis.March 18, 2024\]](https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/hcp/clinical-overview/) CDC’s FOODNET surveillance system found an estimated 3.9 domestic cases per 100,000 population in 2022. [\[15\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[16\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

## Pathophysiology

Shigellosis is characterized by acute inflammatory colitis and bloody diarrhea. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[17\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) _Shigella_ are transmitted predominantly via fecal-oral or close personal contact. [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) The infecting dose of _Shigella_ is extremely low; as few as 10 organisms can cause disease. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) _Shigella_ are acid-resistant and survive passage through the stomach to access the intestine. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) _Shigella_ multiply in the small intestine and enter the colon; the colonic mucosa is the site of pathogenic events in shigellosis. They generally do not penetrate beyond the mucosa, which explains why _Shigella_ bacteremia is so rare.

_Shigella_ crosses the colonic mucosal membranes via transcytosis through the basolateral epithelial M cells into macrophages. [\[18\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) The bacteria evade the phagolysosome and activate macrophage apoptosis. [\[19\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) The release of inflammatory cytokines, eg, interleukins 1 and 8, activates the innate immune system and initiates an inflammatory response within the colonic mucosa. After release from apoptotic macrophages, _Shigella_ initiates a multistep invasion on the basolateral side of enterocytes that reorganizes the epithelial cytoskeleton, induces actin polymerization, and results in endocytosis of the bacteria into the host cell. Bacterial invasion triggers nuclear factor kappa B, which produces interleukin 8, which attracts neutrophils to the invasion site. The resulting inflammatory response further damages the epithelium, degrades the epithelial barrier, and leads to diarrhea. [\[20\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[21\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

_Shigella_ produces 3 enterotoxins: ShET1, ShET2, and Shiga toxin (Stx). The chromosomally encoded ShET1 is most frequently produced by _S flexneri,_ whereas the virulence plasmid-encoded ShET2 can be found in any species. Stx is the main virulence factor produced by _S dysenteriae_ type 1; production of Stx by _S sonnei_ and _S flexneri_ has been reported. [\[22\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[23\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Stx is not essential for the development of shigellosis symptoms but does contribute to illness severity; the role of Stx in enterocyte injury has been partially elucidated. [\[24\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Systemic manifestations of _Shigella_ infection, including complications of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), are at least partially mediated by Stx. [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) A molecularly identical Stx is also produced by enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) serovar O157:H7, which is also associated with HUS.

Enterocyte injury by _Shigella_-mediated enterotoxins creates ulcers in the intestinal mucosa, particularly the colon, and adds a hemorrhagic component to the pathophysiologic manifestations of shigellosis. [\[1\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Access to the underlying lamina propria further perpetuates the inflammatory response. [\[25\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) The resulting small-volume stools containing leukocytes from the inflammatory response, erythrocytes from intestinal ulceration, and bacteria comprise the classic dysentery syndrome of symptomatic shigellosis.

## Histopathology

Histopathologic examination of intestinal mucosal biopsies is neither recommended nor required to diagnose shigellosis. However, macroscopic examination of the _Shigella_-infected tissues reveals inflammation, ulcerative necrosis, hyperemia, and edema. Microscopic examination of fecal smears may reveal sheets of polymorphonuclear cells (see **Images**. Hemorrhagic Colonic Mucosa and _Shigella_ Organisms). [\[26\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/# "Go to other sections in this page")

## History and Physical

The clinical manifestations of shigellosis usually begin within 1 to 4 days following exposure. The clinical spectrum of the disease varies with the infecting species and the quality of host defenses. The disease course may be self-limited in immunocompetent persons and last 5 to 7 days. However, the disease is typically more severe and prolonged in young children, older persons, individuals living with HIV, and malnourished persons. _S sonnei_ usually causes a mild illness limited to watery diarrhea. _S flexneri_ and _S dysenteriae_ type 1 are more likely to cause bloody diarrhea. When obtaining a medical history from patients with the signs or symptoms of shigellosis, a thorough exposure history, including sexual practices, sick contacts, and recent travel, must be obtained. Approximately 70% to 90% of patients with shigellosis will report abdominal pain ranging from mild discomfort to severe, diffuse, colicky pain. Another 70% to 80% describe small-volume mucoid diarrhea, and 30% to 50% experience bloody diarrhea. [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Patients commonly report fever, anorexia, lethargy, fatigue, malaise, and tenesmus.

Patients with an acute diarrheal illness require a complete set of vital signs; fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension are suggestive of more severe disease and potential dehydration. The abdominal examination may range from essentially normal to distention, diffuse tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds, particularly in the left lower quadrant. Severe disease may result in altered mental status, frank delirium, encephalopathy, seizures, meningismus, and coma. Evidence of sepsis, acute kidney injury, HUS, toxic megacolon, or reactive arthritis is indicative of severe shigellosis. [\[28\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[29\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

[Go to:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/# "Go to other sections in this page")

## Evaluation

**Stool Testing and Culture**

The diagnosis of shigellosis is confirmed when the bacteria are identified in the fecal material of a symptomatic person. A stool sample should be obtained from patients with shigellosis-type symptoms or signs for analysis and culture; stool samples are superior to rectal swabs. Approximately 70% of stool samples from patients with shigellosis will reveal fecal leukocytes and blood. [\[27\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Most _Shigella_ cases in the United States are now diagnosed using culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs), eg, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). [\[16\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) CIDTs also promote the tracking and prevention of outbreaks and the detection of antibiotic resistance patterns. However, NAATs do not distinguish between enteroinvasive _E coli_ and _Shigella_ spp; they do not provide information on the species or drug susceptibility, so a stool culture remains vital.

Blood cultures may be recommended in patients with severe cases of shigellosis. [\[30\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) While most patients with shigellosis will not have _Shigella_-associated bacteremia, bacteremia is associated with increased mortality rates. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Bacteremia is most likely to occur in patients at increased risk of severe disease, eg, extremes of age and those who are immunocompromised. [\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

**Laboratory Studies**

Laboratory studies are not required to diagnose shigellosis. However, patients with evidence of dehydration, severe disease, or clinical complications will benefit from diagnostic laboratory evaluations. A complete blood count may reveal a leukocytosis with a left shift; anemia and thrombocytopenia may be present. [\[33\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) When microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia are accompanied by renal failure, HUS should be strongly suspected.

Mild elevations in transaminases and electrolyte disturbances may be seen in patients with severe shigellosis. However, hyponatremia is most commonly due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. [\[34\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Azotemia may indicate dehydration or HUS. [\[34\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Inflammatory markers, eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, are frequently elevated in severe disease but are nonspecific.

## Treatment / Management

**Supportive Management**

The mainstay of shigellosis treatment is supportive care, consisting primarily of hydration and electrolyte management. Oral rehydration suffices in most cases; in more severe cases, intravenous fluid rehydration with or without hospitalization may be necessary. Antimotility drugs, eg, loperamide, paregoric, or diphenoxylate, are contraindicated in patients with _Shigella_ infection and other forms of dysentery; these medications may worsen the condition and cause toxic megacolon. [\[35\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

**Antimicrobial Therapy**

Antimicrobial therapy is not usually recommended for mild cases of shigellosis. However, antimicrobials are recommended if a patient requires hospitalization, is bacteremic or septic, is immunocompromised, is a food handler, or works with small children or in institutions. Antimicrobials shorten the duration of shigellosis by 2 days, limit transmission to others, and reduce the risk of HUS in cases of _S dysenteriae_ type 1. [\[36\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[37\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) The choice of antimicrobial therapy for shigellosis should be made after accounting for local antimicrobial resistance dataand the risk profile of each patient, including recent travel history if the infection was acquired in Asia or Africa, sexual practices, previous antimicrobial use, homelessness, and immunosuppression.

Antimicrobial resistance in _Shigella_ has been increasing worldwide and is a significant public health problem. In the United States, 55% azithromycin- and 23% fluoroquinolone-resistance levels were identified in San Diego among _S flexneri_ and _S sonnei_ isolates, which were comparable to national reports. [\[38\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) In 14 Asian countries, the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance was 29.8% for ciprofloxacin, 29.2% for azithromycin, and 23.8% for ceftriaxone among Shigella spp. [\[39\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Resistance mechanisms in _Shigella_ arise through either plasmid-encoded resistance or horizontal transfer of antimicrobial-resistance genes between bacteria. [\[40\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

**Whole-genome sequencing**

Using whole-genome sequencing, following the path of these resistant genetic elements worldwide is possible. [\[41\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) An extensively drug-resistant _S sonnei_ outbreak was internationally linked to MSM in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, France, and the United States of America. [\[2\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) These strains carry a plasmid-encoded _extended-spectrum β-lactamase_ ( _ESBL_) gene, _bla_ CTX-M-27, that renders them penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant; this plasmid can be transmitted to other bacterial genera. [\[41\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Other plasmids, including IncFII, have resulted in resistance to azithromycin. [\[42\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Yet other _ESBL_ genes have expanded the prevalence of _ESBL_-producing _Shigella_. [\[42\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Rising antimicrobial resistance is concerning because of uncertainty regarding the efficacy of empiric antibiotic therapy in patients with shigellosis.

**Recommendations for antimicrobial therapy**

Shigellosis has no steadfast rules for treating shigellosis. In general, if a patient with moderate illness is in the outpatient setting and at low risk for antimicrobial resistance, fluoroquinolones are the drug of choice for empiric therapy; however, if possible, treatment should be guided by antibiotic sensitivities. [\[43\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Before antibiotics are administered, EHEC (eg, O157:H7) infection should be excluded as the cause of symptoms, given the increased risk of HUS with beta-lactam use. [\[44\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

While Public Health England leaves the choice of antibiotics to the treating clinician, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends oral ciprofloxacin or azithromycin, as does the Canadian Public Health Agency. [\[CDC.Clinical Overview of Shigellosis.March 18, 2024\]](https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/hcp/clinical-overview/) [\[Government of Canada.For health professionals: Shigellosis (Shigella).January 29, 2024\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/shigella/health-professionals.html#a4) The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all cases of bloody diarrhea with an antimicrobial known to be effective against _Shigella_. In the treatment of children, the WHO recommends either ciprofloxacin, pivmecillinam, or ceftriaxone, and the same antibiotics, with the additional option of azithromycin, for adults. [\[45\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) The WHO lists ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracyclines, and nalidixic acid as inappropriate due to extensive antimicrobial resistance among Shigella spp and nitrofurantoin, oral aminoglycosides, first or second generation cephalosporins, and amoxicillin as unsuitable due to poor penetration of the intestinal mucosa. [\[43\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Zinc supplements should be given to children with watery diarrhea. [\[46\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

Third-generation cephalosporins are recommended in high-risk patients, including infected patients in Africa and Asia, international travelers, patients with HIV, and men who have sex with men. Carbapenem antimicrobials may be considered for patients at high risk for antimicrobial resistance, those who have been ill for 3 to 5 days or more, those who have failed outpatient antimicrobial therapy, or those who have been hospitalized. A recent study from the United Kingdom recommended treating hospitalized patients with severe extensively drug-resistant shigellosis with parenteral carbapenems and colistin or oral pivmecillinam and fosfomycin for patients with a prolonged course of illness or as an oral step-down regimen after intravenous therapy. [\[47\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

Parenteral antibiotics are indicated in children when shigellosis is suspected or proven when they are septic, bacteremic, febrile with a temperature above 39 °C (102.2 °F), are immunosuppressed, are infected with HIV, or are unable to take oral medications. The treating clinician should consider switching antibiotics if no response is noted after 2 full days of first-line antibiotics, particularly in settings where antibiotic resistance is common, eg, among sexually transmitted _Shigella_ in MSM. [\[48\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Ceftriaxone intravenously or intramuscularly is recommended in this population for 3 days. Amoebiasis should be considered if no definitive diagnosis of _Shigella_ infection is observed.

While EHEC-associated diarrheal disease is indistinguishable from shigellosis, it differs epidemiologically, as EHEC is associated with undercooked meat or fomites contaminated with manure from food or water. Antibiotics, particularly β-lactams, are relatively contraindicated in EHEC-associated HUS, as they may indirectly trigger the release of Shiga toxin, leading to renal and gastrointestinal injury. [\[49\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

Frequent handwashing with soap and water is recommended, especially after using the bathroom and before food preparation. Food handlers should not engage in food preparation if stool cultures remain positive. Patients should refrain from sexual contact for at least 2 weeks after symptoms have subsided.

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of shigellosis includes infection with bacteria or viruses that cause a similar clinical picture of fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, including:

- Nontyphoidal _Salmonella_(see **Image**. _Shigella Salmonella_)

- _Escherichia coli_(enteroinvasive or enterohemorrhagic)

- _Campylobacter_ spp

- _Clostridioides difficile_

- Typhoid fever (S _almonella enterica_ serotype Typhi and, less frequently, _Salmonella enterica_ serotypes and paratyphi A, B, and C)

- _Entamoeba histolytica_(amoebiasis)

- _Aeromonas_ spp

Noninfectious causes that are included in the differential diagnosis of shigellosis that manifest as chronic diarrhea include:

- Inflammatory bowel disease

- VIPoma

- Hyperthyroidism

- Lactose intolerance

- Celiac disease

- Irritable bowel syndrome

## Prognosis

Shigellosis is usually a self-limited disease and resolves within 5 to 7 days. In more severe cases and when patients seek medical care, shigellosis should be included in the differential diagnosis, and treatment should be initiated promptly, especially if the patient is a returning traveler. If shigellosis is diagnosed and treated on time, the prognosis is good, and patients usually recover without sequelae.

Certain poor prognostic factors may increase morbidity and mortality. These include delays in administering appropriate therapy when the patient is immunocompromised, prolonged disease duration (>7 days), extremes of age, and bacteremia. Bacteremia, which carries a 20% mortality rate, is rare and occurs mainly in malnourished children. [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

Complications of shigellosis include HUS, defined by the triad of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. HUS is a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; its hallmark is the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral smear. The mortality rate is up to 36%. [\[50\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

## Complications

Complications of _Shigella_ infection include the following intestinal and systemic complications:

- **Intestinal complications**

  - Colonic perforation: This complication occurs with _S flexneri_ and _S dysenteriae_ type 1. Colonic perforation is rare and most often occurs in infants and malnourished patients. [\[51\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Intestinal obstruction: Intestinal obstruction is usually seen in severe disease and _S_ _dysenteriae_ type1. [\[52\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Toxic megacolon: This condition usually occurs in _S_ _dysenteriae_ type1 infection. [\[34\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Proctitis or rectal prolapse: This complication is caused by invasion of _Shigella_ into colonic mucosa; the complications are most commonly seen in infants and young children. [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

- **Systemic complications**

  - Bacteremia is rare, most often in children younger than 5 years. [\[30\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[31\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[32\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Although uncommon, HUS is one of the most frequent causes of acute kidney injury in young children and infants. [\[6\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Moderate to severe hypovolemia may develop.

  - Hyponatremia can be seen with _S_ _dysenteriae_ type1 infection. [\[34\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - A leukemoid reaction is common in children aged 2 to 10 years. [\[53\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Generalized febrile seizures are the most common neurologic complication and are usually associated with a higher mortality rate. [\[54\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) [\[55\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - A sterile, inflammatory reactive arthritis is usually caused by _S_ _flexneri_ infection. Arthritis can occur alone or in conjunction with conjunctivitis and urethritis. [\[56\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Vulvovaginitis with or without diarrhea can occur in young girls and is associated with painless vaginal discharge. [\[57\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Keratitis is a rare complication that should be considered in a young child with keratitis and a history of recent diarrheal illness. [\[58\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

  - Acute myocarditis: occurs mostly in children with _S sonnei_ infection. [\[59\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

## Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients with shigellosis and their household members should be educated about appropriate infection control practices to prevent transmission of _Shigella_ to others. Stool precautions and careful handwashing can prevent the dissemination of shigellosis. Primary preventive measures include universal access to potable water, improved personal and food hygiene, fly control, and sanitation measures. [\[60\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#)

Clinicians should recommend the following to their patients:

- Stay home from school, the healthcare environment, jobs in childcare, and food handling when they are sick or until it is safe to return to work as per the national guidance.

- Avoid any sexual contact (anal, oral, penile, or vaginal) while they are still having diarrhea and for 2 weeks after it ends.

- Handwashing should be frequent and be performed with soap and water for 20 seconds, particularly after using the toilet and cleaning up after someone who is sick.

- During this period, they should not prepare food for others.

- Patients should also abstain from using water playgrounds, hot tubs, and bodies of water, eg, oceans, lakes, and rivers.

## Pearls and Other Issues

Although no vaccine has been developed to prevent shigellosis, measures can be taken to prevent transmission of _Shigella_. [\[60\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482337/#) Regularly implementing these measures, especially in high-risk settings and during high-risk practices, could prevent the disease altogether or minimize the severity of illness in those infected. These infection prevention measures include:

- Performing frequent and thorough handwashing with soap and water, especially before meals and in case of contact with people at high risk of transmitting _Shigella_

- Performing supervised handwashing for children in their homes and daycare centers, especially when children are not yet toilet-trained

- Handling and disposing of diapers cautiously when children are not toilet-trained and have a _Shigella_ infection

- Drinking boiled or treated water and avoiding eating raw, poorly handled food from vendors when visiting developing countries

- Avoiding sexual contact with people who have diarrhea, confirmed shigellosis, or have recently recovered from diarrheal illness

- Practicing safe sex

- Avoiding swimming pools during or recently after a diarrheal illness

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Shigellosis is an acute diarrheal infection caused by enteroinvasive Shigella species, which produce colonic inflammation and symptoms ranging from watery diarrhea to bloody, mucoid stools. Transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route, and risk increases among young children, older adults, immunocompromised individuals, international travelers, and men who have sex with men. The illness may mimic other diarrheal diseases, and although many cases are self-limited, others progress to severe complications. Definitive diagnosis relies on stool cultures and susceptibility testing, which are essential given the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and regional variability in drug responsiveness.

Effective patient-centered care requires coordinated teamwork among emergency physicians, internists, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and public health professionals. Clinicians must apply strong diagnostic skills, differentiate shigellosis from similar conditions, and initiate timely supportive therapy focused on hydration and electrolyte management. When antibiotics are indicated, physicians and pharmacists collaborate to select agents guided by susceptibility data and travel or exposure history. Nurses reinforce prevention strategies, including hygiene, sexual health counseling, and traveler education, while monitoring for dehydration and complications. Clear interprofessional communication ensures prompt reporting to public health authorities, optimizes patient safety, improves outcomes, and strengthens team performance across the continuum of care.
